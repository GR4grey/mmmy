This function is the main code for "Loss Control with Rank-one Covariance Estimate for Short-term Portfolio Optimization" [1]. 
It adopts a novel rank-one covariance estimate in the principal
rank-one tangent space at the observation matrix in a novel loss control
scheme, which effectively catches the instantaneous risk structure and avoids extreme losses.

For any usage of this function, the following paper(s) should be cited as
