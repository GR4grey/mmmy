This function is the main code for "Loss Control with Rank-one Covariance Estimate for Short-term Portfolio Optimization" [1]. 
It adopts a novel rank-one covariance estimate in the principal
rank-one tangent space at the observation matrix in a novel loss control
scheme, which effectively catches the instantaneous risk structure and avoids extreme losses.

For any usage of this function, the following paper(s) should be cited as

Inputs:
data                      -data with price relative sequences
win_size                  -window size
tran_cost                 -transaction cost rate
gamma                     -the mixing parameter that trades off between
return and risk

Outputs:
cum_wealth                -cumulative wealths
daily_incre_fact          -daily increasing factors of SSPO
daily_port_total          -daily selected portfolios of SSPO

Example:
[ cum_wealth, daily_incre_fact, daily_port_total] = SPOLC_run(data,5,0.025,0);
%}

%% Parameter Setting

%% Variables Initialization
[T N]=size(data);
cum_wealth = ones(T, 1);
daily_incre_fact = ones(T, 1);
daily_port = ones(N, 1)/N;  
daily_port_total=ones(N, T)/N;
daily_port_o = zeros(N, 1);
run_ret=1;

%% Main
for t = 1:T
    %Calculate t's daily increasing factor and cumulative wealth
    daily_port_total(:,t)=daily_port;
    daily_incre_fact(t, 1) = (data(t, :)*daily_port)*(1-tran_cost/2*sum(abs(daily_port-daily_port_o)));

    run_ret = run_ret * daily_incre_fact(t, 1);
    cum_wealth(t) = run_ret;
    
    % Adjust portfolio for the transaction cost issue
    daily_port_o = daily_port.*data(t, :)'/(data(t, :)*daily_port);
    
    %Update portfolio
     if(t<T)
       [daily_port_n]=SPOLC_extract(data,win_size,gamma,t);
